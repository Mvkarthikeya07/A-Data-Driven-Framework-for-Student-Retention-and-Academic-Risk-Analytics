🎓 A Data-Driven Framework for Student Retention and Academic Risk Analytics

📌 Overview

Educational institutions face increasing challenges related to student dropouts, academic underperformance, and lack of early intervention mechanisms. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual judgment and fragmented data, making it difficult to identify at-risk students at scale.

This project presents a data-driven academic intelligence framework that analyzes large-scale institutional student data to assess student retention levels and academic risk patterns.
Rather than focusing on individual predictions, the system provides institution-level insights that support data-informed academic decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze large-scale student data using academic indicators

To identify academic risk levels (Low / Medium / High) across a student population

To compute student retention metrics at the institutional level

To visualize attendance trends and risk distributions

To support early academic intervention and policy decisions

🧠 Core Concept

This project is designed as a Decision Support System (DSS) for educational institutions.

It does not predict outcomes for a single student.
It analyzes patterns across groups of students (class, batch, or institution).

Key Insight:

Academic success and dropout risk are multi-dimensional, influenced by attendance, academic performance, and behavioral factors.

📊 Dataset Description

A synthetic dataset of 10,000 students is used to ensure:

Privacy preservation

Scalability testing

Realistic academic behavior simulation

Dataset Features:

Attendance (%)

Internal Marks

Behavior Score (1–9)

Study Hours

Final Academic Outcome

Derived Academic Risk Level

Synthetic data enables ethical experimentation without exposing real student records.

⚙️ Risk Classification Logic

Academic risk is determined using transparent, rule-based logic:

🔴 High Risk

Attendance < 60

OR Marks < 45

OR Behavior ≤ 2

🟠 Medium Risk

Attendance between 60–74

OR Marks between 45–59

🟢 Low Risk

Attendance ≥ 75

Marks ≥ 60

Behavior ≥ 3

This approach ensures interpretability, aligning with responsible AI principles.

📈 System Architecture

Pipeline Flow:

Student Data → Risk Classification → Aggregation → Analytics → Dashboard Visualization


The framework is modular and extensible, enabling future integration of:

Explainable ML models

Intervention recommendations

Academic policy simulations

These visualizations demonstrate how institutions can quickly identify risk patterns and engagement trends.

📅 Attendance Trend Interpretation

The month-wise attendance graph represents aggregated engagement trends across an academic cycle.
Months are used as analytical time segments, enabling institutions to identify:

Declining engagement periods

Seasonal attendance variations

Correlation between attendance and academic risk

🎓 Why Student Retention Matters

Student retention refers to the institution’s ability to ensure that students:

Remain enrolled

Progress academically

Do not drop out prematurely

Low retention rates often indicate:

Academic stress

Poor engagement

Lack of early support mechanisms

This framework enables early identification of such issues.
